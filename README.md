# other commitments
* Do you have any other commitments during the main GSoC time period? For

around minor scheduling issues, but if you lie about your availability and
then fall behind on your work you will be failed.

* Have you applied with any other organizations? If so, do you have a preferred
project/org? (This will help us in the event that more than one organization
decides they wish to accept your proposal.)
