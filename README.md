* Proposal Detailed Description/Timeline:
  * Please include timeline with milestones, preferably weekly ones. All
  * pre-work such as setup and reading documentation should take place during
  * community bonding.

# other commitments
* Do you have any other commitments during the main GSoC time period? For
example: Exams, classes, jobs, holidays, weddings. Be honest: we can work
around minor scheduling issues, but if you lie about your availability and
then fall behind on your work you will be failed.

* Have you applied with any other organizations? If so, do you have a preferred
project/org? (This will help us in the event that more than one organization
decides they wish to accept your proposal.)
