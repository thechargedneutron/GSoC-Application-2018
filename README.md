# Code sample:
Some fancy line regarding my interest in Open Source.

I have extensively contributed to scikit-learn and dipy. My contributions are listed below:  
## Contributions to dipy  
[[#1406]](https://github.com/nipy/dipy/pull/1406) assert_true which checks for equality replaced with assert_equal  
[[#1407]](https://github.com/nipy/dipy/pull/1407) Default colormap changed in examples  
[#1414](https://github.com/nipy/dipy/pull/1414) Switching tests to pytest and removing nose dependencies  
[#1422](https://github.com/nipy/dipy/pull/1422) Improves delimiter in read_bvals_bvecs  

## Contributions to scikit-learn


* Link to a patch/code sample, preferably one you have submitted to your sub-org. Must be publicly available and your own work. Applications without a valid code sample will be rejected.

# Project info
* Proposal Title:  Include the name of your sub-org and explain in a few
* words what you plan to do.
* Proposal Abstract:
* Proposal Detailed Description/Timeline:
  * Please include timeline with milestones, preferably weekly ones. All
  * pre-work such as setup and reading documentation should take place during
  * community bonding.

# other commitments
* Do you have any other commitments during the main GSoC time period? For
example: Exams, classes, jobs, holidays, weddings. Be honest: we can work
around minor scheduling issues, but if you lie about your availability and
then fall behind on your work you will be failed.

* Have you applied with any other organizations? If so, do you have a preferred
project/org? (This will help us in the event that more than one organization
decides they wish to accept your proposal.)
