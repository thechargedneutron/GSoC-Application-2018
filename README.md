# Code sample:
Some fancy line regarding my interest in Open Source.

I have extensively contributed to scikit-learn and dipy. My contributions are listed below:  
## Contributions to dipy  
* [[#1406](https://github.com/nipy/dipy/pull/1406)] assert_true which checks for equality replaced with assert_equal  
* [[#1407](https://github.com/nipy/dipy/pull/1407)] Default colormap changed in examples  
* [[#1414](https://github.com/nipy/dipy/pull/1414)] Switching tests to pytest and removing nose dependencies  
* [[#1422](https://github.com/nipy/dipy/pull/1422)] Improves delimiter in read_bvals_bvecs  

* [[#9536](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9536)] Backports msg in assert\_raises and assert\_raises\_regex
* [[#9588](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9588)] Adds helpful messages in all error assertions in estimator\_checks
* [[#9584](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9584)] Implements ducktyping to allow for alternative Memory implementations

* [[#9683](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9683)] Addresses test errors on numpy-dev
* [[#9677](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9677)] Changes default for return\_train\_score to False
* [[#9717](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9717)] Deprecates gaussian process regression\_models and correlation\_models.
* [[#9257](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9257)] Adds a new class RegressorChain similar to ClassifierChain
* [[#9875](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/9875)] Improves class design for Agglomerative Clustering and FeatureAgglomeration

* Link to a patch/code sample, preferably one you have submitted to your sub-org. Must be publicly available and your own work. Applications without a valid code sample will be rejected.

# Project info
* Proposal Title:  Include the name of your sub-org and explain in a few
* words what you plan to do.
* Proposal Abstract:
* Proposal Detailed Description/Timeline:
  * Please include timeline with milestones, preferably weekly ones. All
  * pre-work such as setup and reading documentation should take place during
  * community bonding.

# other commitments
* Do you have any other commitments during the main GSoC time period? For
example: Exams, classes, jobs, holidays, weddings. Be honest: we can work
around minor scheduling issues, but if you lie about your availability and
then fall behind on your work you will be failed.

* Have you applied with any other organizations? If so, do you have a preferred
project/org? (This will help us in the event that more than one organization
decides they wish to accept your proposal.)
